<h2>Introduction</h2><br>
<p>This is my simple To-Do list application which works on file handling principles, we can add, delete, modify and clear tasks in our day to day life using this simple application as tool.</p><br>
<h2>Functionality</h2>
<p>This application uses <fstream> for handling opening, reading, writing and closing files (text file). Methods for writing, reading and appending tasks were done using ifstream, ofstream and fstream calls.</p>
<br>
<p>This application uses text file "data.txt" for storing all the tasks within local directory making it fully functional for basic use, data.txt is its complete backend where taks are written and read from.</p>
