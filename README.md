<h2>Introduction</h2><br>
<p>This is my simple To-Do list application which works on file handling principles, we can add, delete, modify and clear tasks in our day to day life using this simple application as tool.</p><br>
<h2>Functionality</h2>
<p>This application uses &lt;fstream&gt; for handling opening, reading, writing and closing files (text file). Methods for writing, reading and appending tasks were done using ifstream, ofstream and fstream calls.</p>
<br>
<p>This application uses text file "data.txt" for storing all the tasks within local directory making it fully functional for basic use, data.txt is its complete backend where tasks are written and read from.</p>
<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p>It's very easy to implement, just get this code running into any folder and once exe file is ready you can directly use exe file for the further use, exe file will automatically generate the needed data.txt file in your local directory</p>
<h2>Startup?</h2>
<p>Want to make it as startup application?</p>
<br>
<p>Well, its quite easy to do, just press 'Win+r' and run "shell:startup" command, it'll open up the startup folder where you just have to paste the shortcut of exe file and all set, you can even set your personal icon for exe shortcut file making it look like real application through its properties XD</p>
